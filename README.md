App Backend
This is the backend code for my app, built with Node.js and Express.js. The backend provides the following functions:

User authentication: Users can create a profile and login securely. When a user creates a password, it's hashed and a token is created. User profiles are saved in MongoDB using Mongoose.
Favorites list: Users can save their favorite cryptocurrencies to a favorites list or delete them. All the information is saved in MongoDB.
Deployment: The backend was deployed on Heroku for easy access.
Installation and Usage
To run the backend on your local machine, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using npm install. Then, run the server using npm start.

#Introduction
In this project, we built a web app that displays information about various cryptocurrencies. The app has both a frontend and backend, each serving a specific purpose.

#Frontend
For the frontend, we used React in JavaScript to write the code, along with function components. We also used Chart.js to display the crypto charts. The styling is adaptive to different screen sizes using media queries.

To display the data about cryptocurrencies, we used the Coinpaprika API. This API provides comprehensive information about various cryptocurrencies, including their prices, market cap, and trading volumes.

For state management, we used Recoil. This library makes it easy to manage state across different components in the app, making it easier to develop complex frontend interfaces.

#Deployment: The fronend was deployed on Vercel for easy access.

User authentication: Users can create a profile and login securely. When a user creates a password, it's hashed and a token is created. User profiles are saved in MongoDB using Mongoose.

Favorites list: Users can save their favorite cryptocurrencies to a favorites list or delete them. All the information is saved in MongoDB.

#Conclusion
Overall, this app is a great example of how frontend and backend technologies can work together to provide a seamless user experience. By using React, Chart.js, and Recoil on the frontend, and Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB on the backend, we were able to create an app that is both user-friendly and highly functional. We hope that this project will serve as a useful reference for other developers looking to build similar apps.
