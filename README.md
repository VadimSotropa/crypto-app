App Backend
This is the backend code for my app, built with Node.js and Express.js. The backend provides the following functions:

User authentication: Users can create a profile and login securely. When a user creates a password, it's hashed and a token is created. User profiles are saved in MongoDB using Mongoose.
Favorites list: Users can save their favorite cryptocurrencies to a favorites list or delete them. All the information is saved in MongoDB.
Deployment: The backend was deployed on Heroku for easy access.
Installation and Usage
To run the backend on your local machine, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using npm install. Then, run the server using npm start.
